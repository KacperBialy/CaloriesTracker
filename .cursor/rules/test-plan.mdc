You are an experienced QA engineer tasked with creating a comprehensive test plan for a software project. Analyze the following project information:

<project_code>

</project_code>

<technology_stack>
[tech-stack.md](mdc:.ai/tech-stack.md)

</technology_stack>

Your task is to generate a detailed test plan tailored to the specifics of the project, taking into account the technologies used, code structure, and key elements of the repository.

Before creating the test plan, conduct an in-depth project analysis within the <project_analysis> block in your thought process. Include in the analysis:

1. Key components of the project resulting from code analysis:
   
- List and describe the main components of the project
2. Specificity of the technology stack and its impact on the testing strategy:
   
- Analyze each element of the technology stack and its implications for testing
3. Test priorities based on the repository structure:
   
- Identify and rank testing areas by importance
4. Potential risk areas requiring special attention in tests:
   
- List potential risks and justify why they require special attention

After completing the analysis, create the test plan within the <test_plan> block. The plan should include:

1. Introduction and testing objectives
2. Scope of tests
3. Types of tests to be performed (e.g., unit, integration, performance tests)
4. Test scenarios for key functionalities
5. Test environment
6. Testing tools
7. Test schedule
8. Test acceptance criteria
9. Roles and responsibilities in the testing process
10. Bug reporting procedures

Remember, the test plan should be:

- Precisely tailored to the project context
- Accommodating the specifics of the technologies used
- Prioritizing key repository elements
- Demonstrating high quality and professionalism

Start with the analysis and then proceed to create the test plan. Your final output should consist only of the test plan and should not duplicate or summarize any work done in the project analysis block.
